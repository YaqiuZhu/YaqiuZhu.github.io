abstract = "Early vigour, or faster early leaf area development, has been considered an important trait for rainfed wheat in dryland regions such as Australia. However, early vigour is a genetically complex trait, and results from field experiments have been highly variable. Whether early vigour can lead to improved water use efficiency and crop yields is strongly dependent on climate and management conditions across the entire growing season. Here, we present a modelling framework for simulating the impact of early vigour on wheat growth and yield at eight sites representing the major climate types in Australia. On a typical soil with plant available water capacity (PAWC) of 147 mm, simulated yield increase with early vigour associated with larger seed size was on average 4% higher compared with normal vigour wheat. Early vigour through selection of doubled early leaf sizes could increase yield by 16%. Increase in yield was mainly from increase in biomass and grain number, and was reduced at sites with seasonal rainfall plus initial soil water <300 mm. Opportunities exists for development of early vigour wheat varieties for wetter sites. Soil PAWC could play a significant role in delivering the benefit of early vigour and would require particular attention."
