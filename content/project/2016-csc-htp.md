## Project summary

A key component of modern breeding programs is to quantify valuable traits on breeding lines using methods of high-throughput phenotyping. Several platforms allow rapid capture of images for crop canopies using various cameras. The main challenge is to efficiently process these images to estimate phenotypes. The main task of this project is to develop new processing algorithms to extract crop phenotype from images in the UAV based platform. 


## Project activity
[Chinese Scholarship Council](http://en.csc.edu.cn/) funded Mr. Pengcheng Hu (PhD student in [China Agriculture University](http://www.cau.edu.cn/)) from Oct 2016 to Oct 2017 to work in CSIRO, Brisbane, Australia. During his stay, he was co-supervised by [Prof. Yan Guo](http://zihuan1.cau.edu.cn/art/2012/3/9/art_4420_105360.html), [Dr. Scott Chapman](http://people.csiro.au/C/S/Scott-Chapman) and [Dr. Bangyou Zheng](/). The major tasks of his project were to 1) estimate canopy height of sorghum and wheat from UAV based platform, 2) study the impact of image resolution on the estimation of ground coverage.
