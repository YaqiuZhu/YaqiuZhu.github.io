Australian wheat production is greatly influenced by periods of drought and high temperature. In future climate we expect increases in incidences of low or high temperature and potentially in reduced rainfall. We conducted experiments on flowering time and tillering, and assembled datasets from other researchers to build a new gene-based model to predict heading time. The model was validated over a wide range of environments (ca. 4500 observations) and showed substantial spatial variability of frost and heat events across the Australian wheatbelt in current and future climates. In future climates, the target sowing and flowering windows would be shifted earlier by up to two and one months.
