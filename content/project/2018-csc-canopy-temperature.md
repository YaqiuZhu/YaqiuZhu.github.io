## Research area
Development of hardware and software processing systems to allow capture and analysis of canopy temperature using high-throughput image information from field crop experiments in wheat and cotton.

## Project opportunity

A key component of modern breeding programs is to quantify valuable traits on breeding lines using methods of high-throughput phenotyping. The canopy temperature is an indicator of the water status of crop growth and has been widely used in the crop breeding for water limited environment including Australia and China. The Pheno-Copter aerial platform allows rapid capture of images for crop canopies in situ using thermal camera. The main challenge is to efficiently process these images to estimate canopy temperature. In the DigiScape WaterWise project and GRDC water productivity traits project, thermal images are collected during growth season. The main task of this project is to develop new processing algorithms to extract canopy temperature from thermal images already collected by the Pheno-Copter platform for wheat and cotton. The student/visitor will engage scientists in the DigiScape WaterWise project to develop new algorithms for HTP. 

## Skill required from student:
* Understanding of crop physiology, agronomy, biology, environment science.
* Experience in R program language and high performance computers.
* Familiar with the visualization tools to browse and processing of large datasets.

## Developmental outcomes for student:
* Develop tools/knowledge to analyse large datasets from high throughput phenotyping, especially UAV photography.
* Develop the skill to conduct the scientific research.
* Achieve experience to integrate knowledge in multiple disciplines, e.g. plant physiology, agronomy, breeding.
* Understand the workflow to delivery scientific outputs to stakeholder.
* Publish at least two papers in high impact journals.
