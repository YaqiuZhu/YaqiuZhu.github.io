## Research area

Development of process based model to allow capture genotypic adaptation of wheat phenology

## Project opportunity:

The timings of flowering are primary determinants of wheat adaptation to diverse environments to avoid frost, heat, and terminal drought stresses. As the changing climates, the early sowing provides an opportunity for Australian wheat industry. The phenology of winter wheat needs to be properly simulated for Australia, and extended to other environments including China. Process based models have been demonstrated to address the challenge of adaptation to region-specific crop systems (e.g. wheat) and to provide useful information to breeders and farmers for cultivar selection and management decisions. This project will develop and validate a new process based model which is capable to predict wheat flowering time and other inter-mediate stages using historical and real-time temperature records, especially for winter wheat. The student/visitor will engage scientist in GRDC project and complement with IWYP project to focus on developing new algorithm using existing datasets. 

## Skill required from student:

* Familiar with process-based crop model or functional-structural plant model.
* Understanding in crop physiology, agronomy, biology, environment science.
* Using program language R and high performance computing.

## Developmental outcomes for student:

* Develop the skill to conduct the scientific research.
* Achieve the strong experience to integrate knowledge in multiple disciplines, e.g. climate change, plant physiology, agronomy, biology, and breeding.
* Understand the workflow to delivery scientific outputs to stakeholder.
* Publish one or two papers in high impact journals.
