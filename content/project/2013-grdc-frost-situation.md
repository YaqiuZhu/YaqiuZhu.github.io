Substantial wheat and barley crop losses due to frost are known to occur in each of the major cropping regions of Australia through direct damage to plant tissues and late sowing to avoid main frost risk period.

This project was funded by [GRDC](https://grdc.com.au/) from 2013 to 2015. The major outputs include quantitative data on the frequency of damaging frosts, yield and economic benefits to adapt wheat germplasm and management for current frost situation.
