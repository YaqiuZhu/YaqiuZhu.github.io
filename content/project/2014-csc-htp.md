## Project summary

A key component of modern breeding programs is to quantify valuable traits on breeding lines using methods of high-throughput phenotyping. Several platforms allow rapid capture of images for crop canopies using various cameras. The main challenge is to efficiently process these images to estimate phenotypes. The main task of this project is to develop new processing algorithms to extract wheat phenotype from images. 


## Project activity
[Chinese Scholarship Council](http://en.csc.edu.cn/) funded Dr. Tao Duan (PhD student in [China Agriculture University](http://www.cau.edu.cn/)) from Oct 2014 to Oct 2016 to work in CSIRO, Brisbane, Australia. During her stay, she was co-supervised by [Prof. Yan Guo](http://zihuan1.cau.edu.cn/art/2012/3/9/art_4420_105360.html), [Dr. Scott Chapman](http://people.csiro.au/C/S/Scott-Chapman) and [Dr. Bangyou Zheng](/). The major tasks of her project were to 1) build 3D canopy using time serial photography in early stage growth of wheat for early vigour trait, 2) extract phenotypic traits from images captured unmanned aerial vehicle including ground coverage and NDVI.
