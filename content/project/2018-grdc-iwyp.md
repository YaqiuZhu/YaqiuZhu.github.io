This project focuses on developing our capability to model the effects of traits that combine to impact on harvest index of wheat in the high rainfail environments. It does not work on the impacts of genes per se, but rather on the combinations of traits. This capability will contribute to improved prediction of flowering time in wheat across global high-yielding environments, as well as physiological interpretation of the potential to improve harvest index through manipulation of developmental stages. The modelling establishes the base-line heading time distribution for global wheat production environments and aims to determine what the optimal heading time and development traits should be in different environments and in future climates.
