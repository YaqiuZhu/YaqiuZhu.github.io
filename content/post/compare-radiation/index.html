<h2>Yearly total radiation</h2>
<p>We calculated the yearly total radiation and then anomaly of tatal radiation from 1990 to 2022.</p>

<p>Among 4 data sources, the biggest difference occur since 2016. Then I plot the monthly total radiation since 2016.</p>

<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Since 2016, radiations from SILO PPD and Data Drill are much lower than values from AGCD and NASA POWER and also lower than the long term average. We should be carefull to use them in the crop simulations. Radiations from BOM AGCD sound reasonable especially during winter.</p>
