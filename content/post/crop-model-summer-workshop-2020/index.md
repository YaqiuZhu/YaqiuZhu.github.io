In the Crop Model Summer Workshop in Beijing 2020 organized by Professor Liping Feng, China Agriculture University, I would present our works with title `Crop model: a bridge from genotyping to phenotyping` about 
* high throughput phenotyping using unmanned aerial vehicle
* integration genetic information into crop modeling
* application of crop model in climate adaptation
