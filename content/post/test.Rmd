In the plot segmentation of image-based HTP platforms (e.g. UAV, ground-vehicle), we always need to trim a plot to remove the edge effect, then extracts the pixel values we are interesting. The operation is similar with `cutline` in `gdalwarp` command.

In R, `raster` package provides a function `cellFromPolygon` to extract cull numbers from a polygon. However, `cellFromPolygon` is slightly slow, especially for a larger file. 

For example, the wheat plot from a 20M pixel Sony camera is about 3.4 MB. I want to trim this plot by 20% in each side.
