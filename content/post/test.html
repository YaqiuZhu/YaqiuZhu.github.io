<p>In the plot segmentation of image-based HTP platforms (e.g.Â UAV, ground-vehicle), we always need to trim a plot to remove the edge effect, then extracts the pixel values we are interesting. The operation is similar with <code>cutline</code> in <code>gdalwarp</code> command.</p>
<p>In R, <code>raster</code> package provides a function <code>cellFromPolygon</code> to extract cull numbers from a polygon. However, <code>cellFromPolygon</code> is slightly slow, especially for a larger file.</p>
<p>For example, the wheat plot from a 20M pixel Sony camera is about 3.4 MB. I want to trim this plot by 20% in each side.</p>
